# Twitter-Bot
A simple Twitter bot that essentially grabs memes(images) from Reddit(r/memes) and uploads it at an interval of 10s

Please install the following dependencies

Python module to send HTTP requests:
$ pip install requests

BeautifulSoup, a Python module to scrap images off of a website:
$ pip install bs4

Tweepy, an open-source Python Library to access the Twitter API
$ pip install tweepy

Run the get-memes.py file first, which would create a file locally to save the images, and then proceed to run thebot.py file.
